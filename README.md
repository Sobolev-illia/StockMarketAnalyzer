# StockMarketAnalyzer

This dashboard provides an interactive interface for analyzing stock market data. Users can select individual or multiple stock symbols and specify a date range. The dashboard includes several tabs that display time-series plots, performance metrics, and raw data tables, all updated dynamically based on user input.

User can:
View the closing price trend of a selected stock, with options to see the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and 14-day relative strength index (RSI).
Compare closing prices of multiple stocks on a single plot with consistent color mapping.
Examine cumulative returns, 20-day rolling volatility, and maximum drawdown for selected stocks side by side.
Highlight a specific stock across all comparison plots by clicking on its line, which fades other stocks for easy focus.
Download or export raw OHLC (open, high, low, close) data and volume information via a searchable, paginated data table.

Overall, the dashboard helps users explore historical price movements, assess relative performance across multiple symbols, and identify trends or risk metrics in a unified, interactive environment.
